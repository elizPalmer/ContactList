Contact List project, due 12/05/2024, for Comp 1700
This project manages a list of contacts, stored in a CSV file. 
First, the program tries to open and read a csv file into a stringstream. If it cannot find the file, it creates a new one. 
Then, the user inputs various commands that alter or display certain parts of the Contact List. 
Finally, when the user finishes the program, the altered contact list is saved in contacts.csv. 
I used Dr. Foust's string manipulation functions to trim whitespace and to convert to lowercase. 
When the project is first opened, feel free to begin inputing commands.
